// NotifyOnChanges will cause Tailer to use the filesystem's notification system (inotify, kqueue, etc) to detect file rotations as well as when the file is written to. It will attempt to listen to all events for the directory the file is in (this is required in order to detect when the file is recreated), if it cannot it will listen directly to the file for write updates, and poll to detect when a file is rotated
//
// Heads up, this is still a little flakey in terms of tests (from 0 -> 5% failure rate). I haven't seen any real world issues, but you may run into issues here. If you can get a reproduceable test case and send it to me that would be awesome :D
